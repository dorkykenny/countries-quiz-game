# Countries Quiz Game

It is a game where you guess the details of countries like its capital or which continent it is in. Those are the two categories of the game at the moment. In every game, there are 20 rounds and players are given 3 lives. There will be 4 options, when players select the wrong answer, a life will be deducted. When all 3 lives are exhausted, the player loses. On the other hand, when players get to the 20th round with some lives left, they win the game.

The game can be accessed [here]. Initially, players will be prompted to pick a category. Once one is clicked, the first question immediately pops up, along with 4 option buttons below.
